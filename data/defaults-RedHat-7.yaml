# Default arguments for this Puppet module that apply to Red Hat 7 and
# derivative operating systems.  Environment- and globa-tier data override these
# values.
#
# Notes:
# 1. CPAN has been declared "harmful" to RHEL-based systems (you can search for
#    this, it's all over the web).  That said, there are still many modules that
#    don't yet have RPMs.  So, we are faced with a choice:  either build custom
#    RPMs outselves for each missing package, or use a modified version of CPAN
#    which permits ONLY user-based libs.  Not everyone cares to learn how to
#    build RPMs, or has the time to do so.  As such, CPAN on EL 7 installs
#    automatically with perl-local-lib.  Similar configuration is required.
# 2. As another consequence of Note 1, the Config.pm file is no longer used; it
#    is now user-specific.  Because Puppet runs (normally) as root, this file is
#    now at:  /root/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm
# 3. As a perhaps fatal consequence of Note 1, modules are installed only for
#    the root user.  CPAN users can no longer install system-wide modules.
